# Basic Wave Freeze

You're playing in the Baron lane and have a slight lead over your opponent. The minion wave is currently in the middle of the lane.

## Scenario
- Your opponent has just recalled to base
- You have full HP and mana
- Dragon will spawn in 1:30
- Your jungler is currently on the opposite side of the map

## Question
What is the optimal way to handle the minion wave in this situation?

## Options
1. Push the wave quickly to the enemy tower
2. Last hit only to maintain the wave position
3. Thin out the enemy wave to set up a freeze near your tower
4. Recall immediately to buy items

## Correct Answer
C. Thin out the enemy wave to set up a freeze near your tower

## Explanation
Setting up a freeze near your tower is optimal because:
1. It forces your opponent to overextend for CS
2. Creates opportunities for your jungler to gank
3. Protects you from enemy ganks
4. You can maintain lane control while your opponent loses CS and XP
