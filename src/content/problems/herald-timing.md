# Optimal Herald Timing

You're the jungler and have control of the top side of the map.

## Scenario
- First dragon was taken by the enemy team at 4:00
- It's currently 7:30 into the game
- Both Rift Heralds are still available
- Bottom tower has 2 plates remaining
- Top tower has full plates

## Question
What is the best course of action regarding Herald?

## Options
A) Take Herald immediately and use it top
B) Take Herald immediately and use it bottom
C) Wait for next dragon to spawn, then take Herald
D) Ignore Herald and focus on ganking lanes

## Correct Answer
B) Take Herald immediately and use it bottom

## Explanation
Using Herald bottom is optimal because:
1. It helps break the remaining plates before they fall at 8:00
2. Creates pressure on the opposite side of the next dragon
3. Can potentially deny enemy team tower gold
4. Opens up the map for deeper vision control
