# Slow Push for Dragon

You're in mid lane and dragon is spawning in 45 seconds.

## Scenario
- Both teams are relatively even in gold
- Your team has slightly better dragon-fighting potential
- The wave is currently in the middle of the lane
- Both you and your opponent have teleport available

## Question
How should you manipulate the wave to create the best advantage for your team?

## Options
A) Hard push the wave immediately
B) Start a slow push by only last hitting
C) Freeze the wave in the middle
D) Set up a slow push by thinning the enemy wave slightly

## Correct Answer
D) Set up a slow push by thinning the enemy wave slightly

## Explanation
Setting up a slow push:
1. Creates a large wave that will crash into enemy tower during dragon fight
2. Forces someone to respond to the wave or lose significant resources
3. Gives your team a numbers advantage at dragon
4. Provides a safe way to back and rotate to dragon
