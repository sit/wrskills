# Wave Management for Tower Diving

You're playing a strong early game champion against a scaling champion.

## Scenario
- You have a level advantage (Level 5 vs Level 4)
- Enemy is at 40% HP
- Your jungler is nearby with full HP
- There's a large wave pushing towards enemy tower

## Question
What's the correct wave manipulation before attempting a tower dive?

## Options
A) Let the full wave crash into tower then dive
B) Dive immediately before the wave arrives
C) Thin the wave slightly but ensure cannon minion survives
D) Clear the wave completely then dive

## Correct Answer
C) Thin the wave slightly but ensure cannon minion survives

## Explanation
This approach is optimal because:
1. Cannon minion tanks tower shots longer
2. Fewer minions means tower is easier to reset from
3. Remaining minions provide damage support
4. Gives enough time to execute the dive before enemy reinforcements arrive
