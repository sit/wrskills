# Second Dragon Setup

Your team secured the first dragon (Infernal) and the second dragon (Mountain) is spawning in 1 minute.

## Scenario
- Enemy team has better scaling
- Your team has stronger early game
- Both teams have all summoner spells available
- Both teams have similar gold totals

## Question
What should be your priority in the next 60 seconds?

## Options
A) Clear all jungle camps near dragon
B) Force a teamfight before dragon spawns
C) Set up vision and clear enemy wards while pushing out lanes
D) Save smite and wait in a bush to steal

## Correct Answer
C) Set up vision and clear enemy wards while pushing out lanes

## Explanation
This is the optimal preparation because:
1. Vision control allows you to spot enemy rotations
2. Cleared wards deny enemy team information
3. Pushed lanes create priority for dragon fight
4. Gives your team the initiative to start or zone off dragon
